// this typing style should be always followed when using function based components
// maybe in React overall?
// all in all, PascalCasing noted for React

function Message() {
    // it's happnining boys
    // we finally meet the famous JSX
    // the syntax belwow is JSX
    // JSX stands for JavaScript XML
    // so basically the h1 part is going to be compiled to js eventually
    return <h1>HELLO BITCHES HEHEHEHEH</h1>;
